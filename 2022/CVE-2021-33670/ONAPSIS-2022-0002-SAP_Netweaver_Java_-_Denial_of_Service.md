- Risk Level: High
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2021-33670
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 3056652

## Affected Components Description

One of the principal entry points in all SAP Application Server Java is the HTTP 
Web Server. As part of this service there are many standard components analyzing 
and preprocessing the data sent to and received from the users. Because these 
components are in a critical place, vulnerabilities on them are really serious 
and affect all NetWeaver JAVA based SAP Products.

## Vulnerability Details

SAP Netweaver Java has a stack of standard J2EE filters responsable to do some 
controls and statistical operations over each received request. The vulnerability 
exists because one of those filters is keeping information about the different HTTP 
methods received by the server, but it is not properly controlling how much memory 
it needs to store that information. After sending a specially crafted request, an 
attacker is able to make that filter raise an OutOfMemoryError, making the virtual 
machine crash.

## Solution 

SAP has released SAP Note 3056652 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
