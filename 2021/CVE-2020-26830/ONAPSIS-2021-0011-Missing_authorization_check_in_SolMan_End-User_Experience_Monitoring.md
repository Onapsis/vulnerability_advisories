## Vulnerability Details

The main objective of the End-user Enterprise Monitoring (EEM) app is to upload scripts
which will mimic user actions in order to be able to automatically perform 
different kinds of tests. 

This process is intended to be carried out by SAP administrators who want to monitor their
instances. However, due to a lack of authorization check, any valid user from the Solution
Manager is able to fully utilize this application.

In other words, any valid user is able to craft its own script, upload it and force its execution
by an SMD Agent. Some tasks that can be carried out are: 

* Execution of arbitrary HTTP requests from the SMD Agent.
* Disclosure of sensitive content. 
* Resource consumption of specific services.


## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note #2983204 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2983204.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
